\section{Introduction}

Urban transportation is an essential part of the modern cities. Due to the rapid increase of traffic demands in recent decades, the congestion problem has become very frequent and led to serious economic and environment issues.

To solve it, various approaches have been studied and applied to understand the phenomenons in the urban transportation system. Among them, the most widely used one is the traffic flow theory \citep{nathan_h_gartner_revised_2005}. This approach describes the behaviors of the transportation system by considering the vehicle movements as liquid flows, which matches the general impression of the traffic in modern cities. Hence, the traffic flow theory is very popular and has generated several well-known traffic signal control strategies, like TRANSYT \citep{robertson_tansyt_1969,hale_traffic_2005}, SCOOT \citep{bretherton_r_d_scoot_1982}, TUC \citep{diakaki_multivariable_2002}, etc. In this paper, we also apply some concepts of traffic flows to model the system. Beyond this approach, the kinematic wave theory has been also applied to study the relationship between the traffic density and the traffic flow rate, which led the Cell Transmission Model (CTM) \citep{daganzo_cell_1995,flotterod_operational_2011}. This model can accurately describe the behaviors of traffic flows. Hence, the simulation based on CTM is more approximate with the real system than other well-known queue models \citep{almasri_online_2005}. Benefit from its accuracy, CTM has been applied in the simulation \citep{Su2013}, the observer \citep{CanudasdeWit2012} and the traffic signal control \citep{Pohlmann2010}. Another widely used model for the transportation system is the Petri-Net (PN) \citep{dotoli_urban_2006,ng_review_2013}, which works well with logic controllers.

However, in our opinion, these existing works have done very little to explore the nature of the transportation system. They only focused on the superficial transportation behaviors and failed to show the fundamentals of the transportation phenomenon. Indeed, as a specific physical system, urban transportation network should be able to be studied from more general point of view. In particular, it is observed that the urban transportation system consists of the traffic lanes and the vehicles which can stay in the lanes or travel from one to another. This whole picture reminds us that the transportation system is very similar with the large-scale open thermodynamic system, which consists of connected subsystems (matters) and the energy that can be stored in subsystems or be transferred from one to another. These similarities encourage us to introduce thermodynamic concepts into transportation context to better understand the transportation phenomenons.

In detail, this paper will firstly show the connections between the transportation system and the thermodynamic system. Based on them, the correspondence of the basic concepts will be presented. Then, it will be demonstrated that the transportation system can have a similar notion of the entropy to measure the system disorder. This paper will also present a dissipative law of the transportation entropy to render the system tend to lose its disorder and hence become better organized. Furthermore, the Shannon's entropy will be applied to present the notion of the transportation information. Different with the transportation entropy, the transportation information reflects the liquidity and can better measure the transportation functionality of the system. All the efforts in this paper will build up a novel thermodynamic and information point of view to explore the nature of the transportation system.

\section{Basic Concepts and Conservation of Vehicles}

\subsection{Introduction to Transportation System}

The two fundamental elements of the urban transportation system are the traffic streets and the vehicles. Basically, the connected traffic streets provide a network within cities so that the vehicles can travel from their departure points to their destinations. This is the basic image of the transportation functionality.

In details, a street is a linear traffic area connecting two separate points with a fixed length. When more than two streets meet in a single point, there will be a crossing area among these streets. These crossing areas and the connected streets compose the intersections \citep{papageorgiou_review_2003}. For example, Figure \ref{fig:int4leg} and Figure \ref{fig:int3leg} illustrate two common types of intersections, which connects 4 and 3 streets respectively.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \subfigure[Four streets]
  {\includegraphics{pics/int4leg}\label{fig:int4leg}}\quad
  \subfigure[Three streets]
  {\includegraphics{pics/int3leg}\label{fig:int3leg}}
  \caption{Examples of intersections}
\end{figure}

Based on the directions of vehicles, a street can be further seperated into several traffic lanes. For example, the 4 streets in the intersection illustrated by Figure \ref{fig:int4leg} are all split into two lanes corresponding to two opposite directions. On the other hand, in Figure \ref{fig:int3leg}, the streets all consist of three lanes (Note that in this intersection, the lanes are split based on both the current and the potential directions of vehicles). A street may correspond to more than one traffic signals, but a lane can only correspond to one. Hence, the traffic lanes are more appropriate to be considered as the units of the traffic areas instead of the streets.
%Therefore, the transportation system is considered as the network of traffic lanes in this paper.
For each lane, the appropriate state variable is obviously the number of the vehicles within it, which, in this paper, is called the queue length of the traffic lane.

Now, observe that to accomplish the functionality of transportation, a vehicle need enter the transportation network from its departure point, travel from one lane to another until leaving the system at its destination. This is the fundamental of the transportation system. Hence, the dynamic of the system is reflected by the movements of vehicles. By applying the traffic flow theory \citep{nathan_h_gartner_revised_2005}, these movements can be considered as traffic flows.

Consider a transportation network including $n$ traffic lanes, $n>0$. Figure \ref{fig:flows} illustrates all traffic flows related with the lane $i$, $i\in\{1,\cdots,n\}$. $x_i$ is the queue length of lane $i$; the flow $r_i$ denotes the vehicles entering the lane $i$ from the outside; the flow $\sigma_{i,j}$ (resp, $\sigma_{j,i}$), $j\neq i$, $j\in\{1,\cdots,n\}$, represents the vehicles travel from the lane $j$ (resp, $i$) queue to the lane $i$ (resp, $j$); the flow $d_{i}$ is the output flow denoting the vehicles which leave the transportation system from the lane $i$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{pics/flows}
  \caption{The traffic flows related with the lane $i$}
  \label{fig:flows}
\end{figure}

To describe the dynamic of the transportation system from discrete-time approach, the change of the queue length $x_i$ during the interval $k$, $k\in\mathbb{N}$, is given by
\begin{equation}\label{equ:mdl_gnl_lane}
\Delta x_i(k) = l_i(k)+r_i(k)-d_i(k)
\end{equation}
where $l_i$ is the sum of all exchange flows related with lane $i$, which means
$$l_i(k)=\sum_{j=1,j\neq i}^{n}(\sigma_{i,j}(k)-\sigma_{j,i}(k))$$
Equivalently, in vector form, the transportation system can be represented by the following state-space difference equation
\begin{equation}\label{equ:mdl_gnl}
\vec{x}(k+1)=\vec{x}(k)+\vec{l}(k)+\vec{r}(k)-\vec{d}(k),\quad \forall k\in\mathbb{N}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{x}=[x_1,\cdots,x_n]^T$, $\vec{l}=[l_1,\cdots,l_n]^T$, $\vec{r}=[r_1,\cdots,r_n]^T$, $\vec{d}=[d_1,\cdots,d_n]^T$, and $x_i(k)$ is the queue length of lane $i$ at the beginning of the interval $k$.

It is important to note that without any specific assumption, \eqref{equ:mdl_gnl} is a general model, which suits any kind of transportation system in any circumstance. Based on this general model, the sequel will explore the nature of transportation system from thermodynamic point of view.

\subsection{Introduction to Thermodynamic System}

The fundamental concept for analyzing the large-scale thermodynamic systems is the concept of energy. Indeed, assume that a matter with an unique temperature is called a subsystem, the thermodynamic system consists of a bunch of subsystems, which can store certain quantities of energy and are connected so that the energy can be transferred among them. Let the energy stored inside the subsystems be their state variables, these states change when the energy flows occur between the subsystems and their surroundings (including other subsystems and the outside of the system). In this paper, the work done by either the system or the environment is not concerned, hence the energy flows have only the form of heat which is driven by the temperature differences.

Based on these understandings, \citet{haddad_thermodynamic_2005} presented a discrete-time model for the large scale open thermodynamic system. Now, consider the thermodynamic system including $n$ subsystems. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:Ther_Sys}, the $i$th subsystem is denoted by $\Psi_i$, $i\in \{1,\cdots,n\}$, and its stored energy is denoted by $E_i$. Let $E_i^*>0$ be the thermal capacity of $\Psi_i$, then the temperature of $\Psi_i$ is given by
\begin{equation}\label{equ:temperature}
    T_i= {E_i}/{E^*_i}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  % Requires \usepackage{graphicx}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{pics/HModel}
  \caption{Thermodynamic system}
  \label{fig:Ther_Sys}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:Ther_Sys}, the energy flow supplied by the outside to $i$th subsystem is denoted by $r^e_i$. The flow $\sigma^e_{i,j}$ (resp, $\sigma^e_{j,i}$), $i\neq j$, $i,j\in \{1,\cdots,n\}$, represents the transmission of energy from the $j$th (resp, $i$th) subsystem to the $i$th (resp, $j$th) subsystem. The flow $d^e_i$, $i\in \{1,\cdots,n\}$, represents the energy loss from the $i$th subsystem to the outside of the system. By combining the input, exchange and output energy flows, the dynamic of the energy $E_i$ stored by $\Psi_i$ can be given by
\begin{equation}\label{equ:Ther_Model_SubSystem}
\Delta E_i(k) = \sum_{j=1,j\neq
i}^{n}(\sigma^e_{i,j}(k)-\sigma^e_{j,i}(k))+r^e_i(k)-d^e_i(k)
\end{equation}
which equivalently infers the state-space model of the thermodynamic system
\begin{equation}\label{equ:Ther_Model}
    \vec{e}(k+1)=\vec{e}(k)+\vec{l}^e(k)+\vec{r}^e(k)-\vec{d}^e(k)
\end{equation}
where $\vec{e}(k)=[E_1(k),\cdots,E_n(k)]^T$ is the vector of the energy stored by all subsystems at the beginning of $k$th interval, $\vec{r}^e=[r^e_1,\cdots,r^e_n]^T$, $\vec{d}^e=[d^e_{1},\cdots,d^e_{n}]^T$, and $\vec{l}^e=[l^e_1,\cdots,l^e_n]^T$ represents all exchange flows such that
\begin{equation*}
l^e_i = \sum_{j=1,j\neq i}^{n}
        (\sigma^e_{i,j}-\sigma^e_{j,i}),
\; i\in \{1,\cdots,n\}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Correspondences of Basic Concepts}

Now, compare the transportation model \eqref{equ:mdl_gnl} and the thermodynamic model \eqref{equ:Ther_Model}, it is clearly observed that these two systems have many common aspects. In particular, the vehicles perform very similarly as the energy does in the thermodynamic system. Hence, the vehicles can be considered as the transportation ``energy''. Based on this fundamental correspondence, the thermodynamic concepts can be introduced into the transportation context.

For each traffic lane, it can contain certain amount of vehicles. Meanwhile, the vehicles move between the connected lanes or between a lane and the outside. Obviously, the lanes are like the subsystems in the thermodynamic context, which store energy and exchange energy with their surroundings. Hence, the traffic lane is the corresponding notion of the thermodynamic subsystem and the queue lengths $x_i$ correspond to the energy stored in subsystems $E_i$, $i\in\{1,\cdots,n\}$.

The temperature is also an important thermodynamic concept. For finding its correspondence in transportation context, the corresponding notion of the thermal capacity should be firstly found. Since the lengths of traffic lanes are fixed, hence there exists the maximal capacity for each lane to contain vehicles. Let $x_i^*$, $i\in\{1,\cdots,n\}$, be the capacity of the lane $i$. It is not difficult to observe that the appropriate corresponding notion of the thermal capacity $E_i^*$ is the lane capacity $x_i^*$. Furthermore, we can define the occupancy of a lane as the proportion of the queue length to the capacity, which is given by
\begin{equation}\label{equ:occupancy}
f_i = \frac{x_i}{x_i^*},\quad i\in\{1,\cdots,n\}
\end{equation}
Compared with the equation \eqref{equ:temperature}, the occupancies $f_i$ obviously correspond to the temperatures $T_i$, $i\in\{1,\cdots,n\}$.

In summary, Table \ref{tab:notions} lists the correspondences of the basic concepts between thermodynamic and transportation systems. Now, with these correspondences, the transportation system is analogized to the thermodynamic system, which provides us the opportunity to introduce thermodynamic principles into transportation context as well.

\end{table}

\subsection{Conservation of Vehicle}

The first law of thermodynamics, called the conservation of energy \citep{cengel_thermodynamics:_2001}, indicates that the energy can not be created or destroyed, it can only change forms or be transferred. Specially, the change of the energy stored in any thermodynamic system equals exactly the amount of the net energy exchange with its surroundings.

Correspondingly, the conservation of vehicle holds in any transportation system, which means that the change of the vehicles within a transportation system equals exactly the amount of the net traffic flows between the system and the outside. To show this principle more clearly, the following theorem is presented and proved based on the general transportation model \eqref{equ:mdl_gnl}.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:conservation}
For the transportation system \eqref{equ:mdl_gnl}, define
\begin{equation}\label{equ:total_vehicle}
U \triangleq \vec{\epsilon}^T\vec{x}
\end{equation}
as the total number of the vehicles within the transportation network, and define
\begin{equation}\label{equ:all_io}
Q \triangleq \vec{\epsilon}^T(\vec{r}-\vec{d})
\end{equation}
as the number of the net vehicles moving from the outside into the transportation network, where $\vec{\epsilon} \triangleq \{1,\cdots,1\}$. In any circumstance, the following statement holds $\forall k\in\mathbb{N}$
\begin{equation}\label{equ:conservation}
\Delta U(k) = Q(k)
\end{equation}
where $\Delta U(k)=U(k+1)-U(k)$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
From \eqref{equ:mdl_gnl}, we have
\begin{align*}
U(k+1) &= \vec{\epsilon}^T\vec{x}(k+1)\\
       &=
\vec{\epsilon}^T\vec{x}(k)+\vec{\epsilon}^T\vec{l}(k)+\vec{\epsilon}
^T(\vec{r}(k)-\vec{d}(k))\\
       &= U(k)+\vec{\epsilon}^T\vec{l}(k)+Q(k)
\end{align*}
Hence, \eqref{equ:conservation} is equivalent to
$$\vec{\epsilon}^T\vec{l}(k)=0,\quad \forall k\in\mathbb{N}$$
Now, because
$$l_i(k)=\sum_{j=1,j\neq i}^{n}(\sigma_{i,j}(k)-\sigma_{j,i}(k))$$
it infers that
\begin{align*}
\vec{\epsilon}^T\vec{l}(k) &= \sum_{i=1}^n l_i(k)\\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^n (\sum_{j=1,j\neq i}^{n} \sigma_{i,j}(k)
       -\sum_{j=1,j\neq i}^{n} \sigma_{j,i}(k))\\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1,j\neq i}^{n} \sigma_{i,j}(k)
       -\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1,j\neq i}^{n} \sigma_{j,i}(k)\\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1,j\neq i}^{n} \sigma_{i,j}(k)
       -\sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1,i\neq j}^{n} \sigma_{j,i}(k)\\
    &= 0
\end{align*}
which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

This theorem indicates that the total vehicles in the transportation system depends on only the traffic flows between the system and the outside, the exchange flows between different lanes can not change the total number of the vehicles within the network.

Furthermore,\eqref{equ:conservation} can also infer that
\begin{equation}\label{equ:conservation_ex}
U(k_2) = U(k_1)+\sum_{k=k_1}^{k_2-1}Q(k)
\end{equation}
for any $k_1,k_2\in\mathbb{N}$, $k_2>k_1$. Hence, according to \citep{willems_dissipative_1972-1}, the conversation of vehicle also implies that the transportation system \eqref{equ:mdl_gnl} is lossless with respect to the storage function \eqref{equ:total_vehicle} and the supply function \eqref{equ:all_io}.

\section{Transportation Entropy and Dissipativeness}

\subsection{Second Law of Thermodynamics}

In the thermodynamic system, the energy movements obey not just the conservation principle. Beyond that, more importantly, the directions and the quantities of the energy movements must follow some specific rules. For example, without heating equipment, a hot beverage, like a cup of hot tea, will definitely become cooler in a cold room, the energy can not move from cold air to the hot beverage. These phenomenons are consistent with the second law of thermodynamics (Clausius statement, \citet{clausius_mechanical_1867}):
\begin{quotation}
Heat can never pass from a colder to a warmer body without some other change, connected therewith, occurring at the same time.
\end{quotation}

This principle is usually connected with a special concept: \textbf{entropy}. The second law of thermodynamics can be also described by the way how the entropy of thermodynamic system changes.
% For example, the heat can be transferred from hotter objects to colder ones, but it can never go in the opposite direction. Certain phenomenons have been studied and generated the second law of thermodynamics \citep{cengel_thermodynamics:_2001}, which introduced a special concept.
In particular, Clausius proposed that the increase of the system entropy due to the input energy $Q$ from the environment is $Q/T^a$, where $T^a$ is the absolute temperature at the sport where the energy transmission happens \citep{clausius_mechanical_1867}. However, for any thermodynamic system, the actual increase of entropy is bigger than or equals to the one supplied by the environment. In other words, any thermodynamic system is creating entropy itself. This phenomenon can be presented by the following inequality
\begin{equation}\label{equ:clausius_ther_gnl}
\Delta \psi \ge \int\frac{dQ}{T^a}
\end{equation}
or its discrete-time version \citep{haddad_thermodynamic_2005}
\begin{equation}\label{equ:clausius_ther}
\psi(k+1) \ge \psi(k)+\sum_{i=0}^{n}\frac{Q_i(k)}{T^a_i(k+1)},
\forall k\in\mathbb{N}
\end{equation}
where $\psi$ is the entropy of the thermodynamic system, $Q_i(k)$ is the net energy that $i$th subsystem absorbs from the outside during the interval $k$, and $T^a_i(k+1)$ is the absolute temperature of $i$th subsystem at the end of interval $k$, $i\{1,\cdots,n\}$. \eqref{equ:clausius_ther_gnl} and \eqref{equ:clausius_ther} are also known as Clausius inequality.

The Clausius inequality indicates that in any circumstance, any thermodynamic system is creating entropy so that the increase of its entropy is always beyond the one supplied by its surroundings. The Clausius inequality is consistent  with the second law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, since th entropy is opposite to the capacity of the thermodynamic system to do useful work, it is also regarded as the measure of the system disorder \citep{balmakov_entropy_2001}. Precisely, bigger entropy indicates that the system is worse organized. Hence, the Clausius inequality also implies that the thermodynamic system always tends to become worse organized.

For the discrete-time thermodynamic model \eqref{equ:Ther_Model}, based on the Clausius inequality \eqref{equ:clausius_ther}, \citet{haddad_thermodynamic_2005} presented the formula of its entropy as follows
\begin{equation}
\psi(\vec{e}) \triangleq{\vec{e}^*}^T \ln
(a\vec{\epsilon}+\mat{P}_e\vec{e}) -\vec{\epsilon}^T\vec{e}^*\ln a
\label{equ:Ther_entropy}
\end{equation}
where $\psi(\vec{e})$ is the entropy, $\vec{e}^*=[E^*_1,\cdots,E^*_n]^T$, $a$ is a positive scalar which represents the difference between the absolute temperature and the temperature defined in \eqref{equ:temperature} so that $T^a_i=a+T_i$, $i\in\{1,\cdots,n\}$, and $\mat{P}_e$ is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements $1/E^*_i$.

Note that this formula is identical with the Boltzmann entropy expression for statistical thermodynamics. Indeed, for any subsystem without phase transition, the entropies in different absolute temperatures ($T1$, $T2$) satisfy the following relationship \citep{cengel_thermodynamics:_2001}
\begin{equation}\label{equ:entropy_temperature}
\psi_i(T1)-\psi_i(T2)=e_i^* \ln \frac{T1}{T2},\quad \forall
i\in\{1,\cdots,n\}
\end{equation}
It is known that the absolute temperature of $i$th subsystem equals $a+\frac{e_i}{e_i^*}$. Specially, when the subsystem stores no energy ($e_i=0$), its absolute temperature becomes $a$. Hence, \eqref{equ:entropy_temperature} infers that
\begin{align}
\psi_i(e_i)&=\psi_i(0)+e_i^* \ln \frac{a+\frac{e_i}{e_i^*}}{a}
\nonumber\\
&=\psi_i(0)+e_i^* \ln (a+\frac{e_i}{e_i^*})-e_i^* \ln{a}
\label{equ:tmp_psi_1}
\end{align}
Now, according to the third law of thermodynamics, the entropy approaches zero when the stored energy approaches zero, which means
\begin{equation}\label{equ:entropy_zero}
\psi_i(0)=\lim_{e_i\rightarrow 0}\psi_i(e_i)=0
\end{equation}
Therefore, we have
\begin{equation}
\psi_i(e_i)=e_i^* \ln (a+\frac{e_i}{e_i^*})-e_i^* \ln{a}
\end{equation}
By summarizing all subsystems, the entropy of the whole system is given by
\begin{equation}
\psi(\vec{e})=\sum_{i=0}^n e_i^*\ln(a+\frac{e_i}{e_i^*})-e_i^*\ln a
\end{equation}
which infers the Haddad's formula of entropy \eqref{equ:Ther_entropy}.

Furthermore, since the entropy \eqref{equ:Ther_entropy} is not easy to apply in control issues, \citet{haddad_thermodynamic_2005} also introduced a dual notion to entropy, called ectropy, to measure the system order. Correspondingly, the dual inequality to \eqref{equ:clausius_ther} is given by
\begin{equation}\label{equ:anti_clausius}
\phi(k+1)-\phi(k)\le \sum_{i=0}^n Q_i(k)T_i(k+1),
\forall k\in\mathbb{N}
\end{equation}
where $\phi$ is the ectropy of the thermodynamic system, $Q_i(k)T_i(k+1)$ is the input ectropy of $i$th subsystem supplied by the environment with the net input energy $Q_i(k)$, and $T_i(k+1)$ is the temperature of $i$th subsystem at the end of interval $k$. This inequality is also called anti-Clausius inequality, which, like Clausius inequality, is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics.

Anti-Clausius inequality indicates that in any circumstance, any thermodynamic system is destroying its ectropy so that the increase of the ectropy is always beneath the one supplied from its surroundings. Opposite with the entropy, the ectropy measures the capacity of the system to do useful work, and bigger ectropy corresponds to better organization of the system.

For the discrete-time thermodynamic model \eqref{equ:Ther_Model}, based on the anti-Clausius inequality \eqref{equ:anti_clausius}, \citet{haddad_thermodynamic_2005} presented the formula of the ectropy as follows
\begin{align}
\phi(\vec{e})&\triangleq\frac{1}{2}\vec{e}^T \mat{P}_e \vec{e}
\label{equ:Ther_ectropy}
\end{align}

The entropy \eqref{equ:Ther_entropy} and the ectropy \eqref{equ:Ther_ectropy} are both the function of the energy distribution within the thermodynamic system. Different with the energy, the entropy and the ectropy are both non-conservative notions. Specially in the isolated system, the sum of energy always keeps constant, but the entropy tends to increase while the ectropy tends to decrease. It is important to note that the ectropy \eqref{equ:Ther_ectropy} has the form of Lyapunov candidate function, which is more useful in control issues than the entropy.

\subsection{Transportation Entropy}
The above section has analogized the transportation system to the thermodynamic system, which encourages us to introduce entropy concept into transportation context to be the evaluation of the system performance.

The problem is that there is no natural principle in transportation context that corresponds to the second law of thermodynamics. As a matter of fact, the directions of vehicles are determined by the drivers, there is no such rule that the vehicles only move from more crowded lanes to less crowded ones. Hence, we can not introduce transportation entropy based on certain principles as it is defined in the thermodynamic context. Nevertheless, based on the correspondences of certain concepts, such as energy and temperature, we can still simply introduce the formulas in the thermodynamic system to present the transportation entropy as the measure of the system disorder.

To achieve this idea, the significations of orders in these two systems are firstly compared, and we find that these two significations are opposite. Indeed, in thermodynamic context, higher order means higher capacity to do useful work, which is related with bigger temperature differences between subsystems. For example, in a thermodynamic system including two subsystems, if more energy concentrates on one single subsystem to generate bigger temperature difference, the quantity of the potential energy movements is bigger, which means that the system can generate more useful work. In this case, the system is regarded as better organized and has higher order. But on the converse, the bigger differences between the occupancies correspond to lower order in transportation context. Indeed, for a general transportation network, if more vehicles concentrate in only a few lanes, it has bigger probability to generate congestions in these lanes and the areas in other lanes are wasted. In this case, the system is regarded as worse organized and has lower order.

Moreover, the energy input to the thermodynamic system brings more capacity to do useful work, which increases the order. However, in transportation context, the vehicle input brings more potential opportunity to generate congestions, which decrease the order. For an isolated thermodynamic system without energy input, the disorder (entropy) can only increase until it reaches equilibrium. On the converse, if, at a certain moment, the transportation system has no vehicle input, the system will keep dissipating present vehicles and consequently become better organized.

In conclusion, the order significations of these two systems are opposite, which means the disorder in the transportation system corresponds to the order in the thermodynamic system. In other words, the transportation entropy (resp, ectropy) should correspond to the thermodynamic ectropy (resp, entropy). Therefore, according to the thermodynamic ectropy and entropy formulas \eqref{equ:Ther_ectropy}, \eqref{equ:Ther_entropy}, the \textbf{transportation entropy and ectropy} are defined as
\begin{align}
\label{equ:Tran_entropy}
\psi(\vec{x}) &\triangleq \frac{1}{2}\vec{x}^T \mat{P} \vec{x}\\
\phi(\vec{x}) &\triangleq{\vec{x}^*}^T \ln
(a\vec{\epsilon}+\mat{P}\vec{x}) -\vec{\epsilon}^T\vec{x}^*\ln a
\label{equ:Tran_ectropy}
\end{align}
where $\psi(\vec{x})$ is transportation entropy, $\phi(\vec{x})$ is transportation ectropy, $a$ is a positive scalar, $\mat{P}$ is the diagonal matrix with the diagonal elements $1/x_i^*$, and $\vec{x}^*=[x_1^*,\cdots,x_n^*]^T$.
% Since the Haddad's formula of entropy is identical with the Boltzmann's one, the definitions of the transportation entropy and ectropy can also be considered as consistent with Boltzmann's approach.

It is important to note that the entropy \eqref{equ:Tran_entropy} is a Lyapunov candidate function, which is much more useful in control issues than the ectropy \eqref{equ:Tran_ectropy}. Hence, it will be the major emphasis of the sequel.

The transportation entropy \eqref{equ:Tran_entropy} is supposed to measure the disorder of the transportation network. To show its signification more precisely, we consider the transportation network as a service provider and consider the vehicles traveling within it as its customers. Hence, the order of transportation network should be the sum of the qualities of the services provided to all vehicles, and the disorder is, of course, the opposite. Clearly, the services that the vehicles obtain from the urban transportation system are the traffic routes, and the qualities are evaluated by how fast the vehicles can pass these routes. Figure \ref{fig:d_q} shows the flow-density diagram based on kinetic wave model, where $\rho_m$ is the jam density, $\nu$ is the speed and $\nu_m$ is the free-flow speed \citep{ukkusuri_robust_2010}. It is observed that the traffic flow and the speed can be considered as functions of the traffic density. Precisely, the bigger traffic density generates the smaller speed and hence prolongs the delay. Indeed, despite the habits of drivers, any vehicle need spend more time to pass more crowded lanes. This indicates that the traffic densities are opposite to the qualities of services provided by the transportation network, hence they correspond to the system disorder.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=3cm]{pics/d-q}\\
  \caption{Density-flow chart}
  \label{fig:d_q}
\end{figure}

Now, let $I(k)$ be the sum of the traffic densities that all vehicles meet at the instant $k$, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:sum_density}
I(k)=\sum_{j=1}^{N(k)} \rho_{(j)}(k)
\end{equation}
where $N(k)\in\mathbb{N}$ is the number of vehicles inside the transportation network at the instant $k$, $\rho_{(j)}(k)$ is the traffic density that the vehicle $j$ meets at time point $k$, $j\in\{1,\cdots,N(k)\}$.

In order to show the relationship between $I(k)$ and the entropy \eqref{equ:Tran_entropy}, we assume the following statement always holds.
\begin{ass}\label{ass:distribution}
In each lane, the vehicles are uniformly distributed.
\end{ass}
This assumption is reasonable because the lanes are usually the minimal measurable units in transportation network. Indeed, there have been many methods (e.g., inductive loop detectors) to measure the number of vehicles inside a traffic lane, but it is still hard to obtain the specific vehicle distribution within a lane. Hence, due to this lack of measurement, the simple solution is to assume the uniform distribution of vehicles within a lane.

Assumption \ref{ass:distribution} implies that for the vehicles in the same lane, the traffic densities are the same. Let $\rho_i(k)$ denote the traffic density of the lane $i$ at time point $k$, $i\in \{1,\cdots,n\}$. Hence, \eqref{equ:sum_density} becomes
$$I(k)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i(k)\rho_i(k)$$
Furthermore, since $\rho_i(k)=x_i(k)/h_i$ where $h_i$ is the length of the lane $i$, $i\in \{1,\cdots,n\}$, the sum of the traffic densities of all vehicles is finally restated as
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:quality_service}
I(k)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}
\frac{x_i(k)^2}{h_i}=\vec{x}(k)^T\mat{P}_h\vec{x}(k)
\end{equation}
where $\mat{P}_h$ is the diagonal matrix with the diagonal elements $1/h_i$.

For each lane, its maximal capacity to contain the vehicles is proportional to its length, that means
\begin{equation}\label{equ:proportional_l_x}
h_i \varpropto x_i^*
\end{equation}
Hence, compare the entropy \eqref{equ:Tran_entropy} and the equation \eqref{equ:quality_service}, we have the following conclusion
\begin{equation}\label{equ:conclusion_quality}
I(k) \varpropto \psi(\vec{x}(k))
\end{equation}
which means that the transportation entropy is proportional to the sum of the traffic densities of all vehicles. Consequently, it is implied that the transportation entropy \eqref{equ:Tran_entropy} measures the disorder of the transportation network, which is an appropriate evaluation of the system performance.
% It is also important to note that the entropy \eqref{equ:Tran_entropy} is a Lyapunov candidate function, which is very useful in control issues.

\subsection{Dissipativity of Entropy}

Though the second law of thermodynamics can not be applied in transportation context naturally, we still wonder whether it can be achieved in certain conditions. The major motive is that the transportation disorder corresponds to the thermodynamic order. If the transportation system has similar principle with the second law of thermodynamics, it will have the tendency to decrease its disorder and become better organized. More precisely, if the direction of the net traffic flow between any two transportation areas is from the more crowded one to the less crowded one as the energy does in the thermodynamic system, all congestions within the transportation network will tend to be evacuated.

Now, consider the anti-Clausius inequality \eqref{equ:anti_clausius} and its meaning in thermodynamic context, it can be stated that the idea is to achieve the phenomenon that the increase of the transportation entropy is always beneath its supply from the outside. In other words, the corresponding version of anti-Clausius inequality should be presented and verified.

As described above, in transportation context, the input vehicles bring disorder to the system. This supplied disorder depends on not only the number of the input vehicles, but also the distribution of them. The vehicles which enter the more crowded lanes bring more disorder than the ones with same quantity which enter the less crowded lanes. Since the occupancies represent how the lanes are crowed, it is natural to measure the supplied entropy with respect to the input flows and the occupancy factors. Let $\vec{f}=[f_1,\cdots,f_n]^T$ be the vector of all occupancies. Note that because $\vec{f}(k)$ corresponds to the beginning of the interval $k$ while $\vec{f}(k+1)$ corresponds to the end of it, the supplied entropy in the interval $k$ should correspond to $\vec{f}(k+1)$ rather than $\vec{f}(k)$. So, we define
$$S(k)=\vec{f}(k+1)^T\vec{r}(k)$$
as the supplied entropy in the interval $k$. Furthermore, since $\vec{f}=\mat{P}_x\vec{x}$ in view of \eqref{equ:occupancy}, the supplied entropy is restated as
\begin{equation}\label{equ:supply}
    S(k)=\vec{x}(k+1)^T \mat{P} \vec{r}(k)
\end{equation}
Now, similar with the anti-Clausius inequality \eqref{equ:anti_clausius}, we propose its corresponding version in transportation context as follows
\begin{equation}\label{equ:dissipative}
\psi(\vec{x}(k+1))-\psi(\vec{x}(k)) \leq S(k),\quad \forall
k\in\mathbb{N}
\end{equation}
If this inequality is verified, the transportation system has the tendency to decrease its disorder and become better organized.

Furthermore, according to the \citet{willems_dissipative_1972} and \citet{hill_dissipative_1980}, \eqref{equ:dissipative} also implies the dissipativeness with the entropy \eqref{equ:Tran_entropy} as the storage function and with \eqref{equ:supply} as the supply function. In this case, \eqref{equ:dissipative} is called dissipation inequality. Figure \ref{fig:trans_dis} illustrates this dissipativeness of system disorder. Indeed, the input flows bring disorder to the transportation system to make it worse organized. At the same time, the appropriate traffic signal control dissipates the traffic so that the system stores only a part of this input disorder.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{pics/trans_dis}\\
  \caption{Dissipativity of transportation entropy}
  \label{fig:trans_dis}
\end{figure}

This dissipativeness implies that the storage of the system disorder is always smaller than or equal to the supplied one from the outside. In other words, if this dissipative phenomenon exists in the transportation system, the system disorder will tend to decrease and hence the system will tend to become better organized.

This dissipativeness does not exist naturally. But, it is known that the traffic signals have the ability to control the traffic flows. Therefore, it is possible that under certain control schemes, the traffic signals can verify the dissipation inequality \eqref{equ:dissipative}. This inequality can be considered as one of objectives for traffic signal control.

\section{Nominal Situation and Equilibrium}

In the researches about thermodynamic systems, the closed system,
which has no exchange with the environment, is one of the most
studied subjects. Indeed, the closed thermodynamic system has special
features. For example, in any closed thermodynamic system, the
ectropy (resp, entropy) keeps decreasing (resp, increasing) until
reaching the equilibrium state when all connected subsystems have the
same temperature. The equilibrium also corresponds to the minimal
possible ectropy and maximal possible entropy. Since the ectropy is a
Lyapunov candidate function, the closed thermodynamic system is
Lyapunov stable \citep{haddad_thermodynamic_2005}.

Unfortunately, the transportation system is always open. In fact, the
openness is required by the functionality of the transportation.
There is no such thing as closed transportation system. However,
there exists nominal situation \citep{diakaki_multivariable_2002} in
the transportation network which has some common features with the
closed thermodynamic system. The nominal situation means that with
certain traffic demands and certain traffic signal settings, the
input vehicles equals the output vehicles in any cycle for each
traffic lane, in other words, the queue lengths of all traffic lanes
keep constant from cycle to cycle. In this paper, these certain
traffic demands are called nominal inputs from the outside, denoted
by
$$\vec{r}^N=\{r_1^N,\cdots,r_n^N\}$$
Obviously, in the nominal situation, the net exchange between the
transportation system and the outside equals zero in each cycle, that
means
\begin{equation}\label{equ:nominal_exchange}
Q(k)\equiv 0, \quad \forall k\in\mathbb{N}
\end{equation}
Since the transportation system is lossless with the storage function
$U$ and the supply function $Q$, \eqref{equ:nominal_exchange} infers
that the total amount of traffic $U$ within the whole system keeps
constant in the nominal situation. This is very similar with the
closed thermodynamic system which has zero exchange of energy with
the environment. Hence, we propose that the nominal situation of the
transportation system can be analogized to the closed status of the
thermodynamic system.

Note that \citet{de_oliveira_multi-agent_2010} have presented some
effective procedures to estimate the nominal parameters for the
general transportation system, hence it is reasonable to assume the
availability of the nominal situation in general.

Now, we define
\begin{equation}
\vec{\omega}(k)\triangleq\vec{r}(k)-\vec{r}^N, \quad \forall
k\in\mathbb{N}
\end{equation}
as the vector of the disturbances of the traffic demands. Since the
nominal transportation system corresponds to the closed thermodynamic
system, the disturbances $\vec{\omega}$ are more appropriate than the
input traffic flows $\vec{r}$ to correspond to the input energy in
the thermodynamic system.

Hence, let
\begin{equation}\label{equ:supply_omega}
  S_\omega(k) = \vec{x}(k+1)^T \mat{P} \vec{\omega}(k)
\end{equation}
be the new supply function with respect to $\vec{\omega}$.
Consequently, the dissipativeness presented in previous section can
be modified to the one with the entropy \eqref{equ:Tran_entropy} as
the storage function and with \eqref{equ:supply_omega} as the supply
function. Note that this new dissipativeness is the sufficient
condition of the previous one, which is stated in the following
theorem.

\begin{thm}
If the transportation system described by the difference equation
\eqref{equ:mdl_gnl} is dissipative with respect to the storage
function \eqref{equ:Tran_entropy} and the supply function
\eqref{equ:supply_omega}, then the system is also dissipative with
respect to the same storage function and the supply function
\eqref{equ:supply}.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
The dissipation inequality related with the storage function
(\ref{equ:Tran_entropy}) and the supply function
(\ref{equ:supply_omega}) is
\begin{equation}\label{equ:dissipative_omega}
  \psi(\vec{x}(k+1))-\psi(\vec{x}(k)) \leq S_\omega(k)
\end{equation}
Since $\vec{r}(k)=\vec{q}(k)c$ and
$\vec{\omega}(k)=(\vec{q}(k)-\vec{q}^N)c$, it follows
$\vec{\omega}(k)=\vec{r}(k)-\vec{r}^N$. Hence,
\begin{align*}
S_\omega(k) &= \vec{x}(k+1)^T \mat{P} (\vec{r}(k)-\vec{r}^N(k))\\
    &= \vec{x}(k+1)^T \mat{P} \vec{r}(k)-\vec{x}(k+1)^T \mat{P}
\vec{r}^N(k)
\end{align*}
Since the nominal inputs and all queue lengths are non-negative, this
infers
$$S_\omega(k)\leq \vec{x}(k+1)^T \mat{P} \vec{r}(k) = S(k)$$
So, the conclusion follows.
\end{proof}
Now, the second law of thermodynamics corresponds to this new
dissipativeness.

Finally, we close this section by introducing the concept of thermal
equilibrium into the transportation context. For a closed
thermodynamic system, if a pair of connected subsystems have
different temperatures, the energy transmission will emerge between
them so that their temperatures tend to approximate. After enough
time, all connected subsystems will have the same temperature so that
no energy movement can emerge any more, in other words, the system
loses all its capacity to do useful work in this moment. This
particular state is called thermal equilibrium state
\citep{cengel_thermodynamics:_2001}, which also corresponds to the
maximal entropy and minimal ectropy in the closed thermodynamic
system.

Correspondingly, we present the concept of transportation equilibrium
to denote the state when the occupancies of all traffic lanes are the
same, which implies that the vehicles are uniformly distributed
within the whole transportation area in the transportation
equilibrium. Mathematically, the transportation equilibrium means
\begin{equation}\label{equ:equilibrium}
\frac{x_1}{x_1^*}=\cdots=\frac{x_n}{x_n^*}=\alpha
\end{equation}
where
$$\alpha = \frac{\vec{\epsilon}^T\vec{x}}{\vec{\epsilon}^T\vec{x}^*}
\in[0,1]$$
% It can be easily proved that the transportation equilibrium
% corresponds to the minimization of the transportation entropy with
% certain amount of traffic.
The relationship between the transportation equilibrium and the
transportation entropy is stated in the following theorem.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:entropy_equilibrium}
Assume that the total amount of vehicles $N$ is given, the
transportation entropy \eqref{equ:Tran_entropy} is minimized when the
system reaches the equilibrium state \eqref{equ:equilibrium}.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
To minimize the entropy, consider the problem
\begin{align}\label{equ:pro_min_psi}
\min\; &\psi(\vec{x}) = \frac{1}{2}\vec{x}^T\mat{P}\vec{x}\\
s.t.\; &\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = N \nonumber
\end{align}
It is easy to know that $\psi(\vec{x})$ is a convex function. By
applying the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve the problem
\eqref{equ:pro_min_psi}, we have the equivalent unconstrained
problem:
$$\min J(\vec{x},\beta) =
\frac{1}{2}\vec{x}^T\mat{P}\vec{x}+\beta(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - N)$$
whose solution can be obtained by solving the equations
\begin{align}
\label{equ:tmp_min_J_1}
\frac{\partial J}{\partial x_i} &= \frac{x_i}{x_i^*}+\beta =0,
i\in\{1,\cdots,n\}\\
\label{equ:tmp_min_J_2}
\frac{\partial J}{\partial \beta} &= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i - N =0
\end{align}
Now, \eqref{equ:tmp_min_J_1} can easily infer that
$$\frac{x_1}{x_1^*}=\cdots=\frac{x_n}{x_n^*}=-\beta
$$
Apparently, $\beta$ can only equal to $-\alpha$, which completes the
proof.
\end{proof}

Transportation equilibrium also implies that no particular
concentration of vehicles exists in the system and hence the
possibility to emerge congestion is extremely low. The transportation
equilibrium is actually the ideal state for the transportation system
and the ideal objective shared by all dynamic traffic signal control
strategies.

\section{Approach of Shannon's Entropy}

The above studies analogized the transportation system to
thermodynamic system by regarding the vehicles as the energy. Beside
this approach, it is noticed that the researches of thermodynamics
have been expanded to the domains other than pure physical systems.
In particular, Shannon has connected the entropy with the concept of
information \citep{Shannon1948}. This work encourages us to explore
the nature of the transportation system from the information
perspective, which is the emphasis of this section.

\subsection{Information of Transportation System}

As a very important expansion of the statistical thermodynamics,
Shannon's entropy measures the information gained by measuring
certain random variable \citep{Shannon1948}. In particular, for a
random variable $Y$ with possible states $\{y_i\}$, if the
probability distribution of $Y$ over its possible states is
$\{p_i\}$, then the information gained by measuring $Y$ can be given
by the relative Shannon's entropy as follows
\begin{equation}\label{equ:shannon}
H(Y) = -\sum p_i \log_2 p_i
\end{equation}
Note that by using $2$ as the base of logarithm, the unit of the
information \eqref{equ:shannon} is $\unit{bit}$.

In transportation context, the most important information is the
occupancy status of the traffic areas, which can infer the degree of
crowdedness. Since the Shannon's entropy measures the information
gained by necessary measurement, it means the Shannon's entropy
represents the unknown information or in other words the
unpredictability of the information. In the transportation system, if
the vehicles move more fast, the uncertainty of the occupancy of
certain traffic areas will be bigger, which makes more difficult to
predict the crowdedness of the system. Therefore, if the
transportation system functions more smooth, the information measured
by the Shannon's entropy will be greater.

Now, to measure this information, consider a single spot of lane $i$
firstly, $\forall i\in\{1,\cdots,n\}$. Suppose that the queue length
$x_i$ and the lane capacity $x_i^*$ are both known but there is no
direct measurement on this specific spot. It can be inferred that the
possibility that this spot is occupied is $\frac{x_i}{x_i^*}$, and
the possibility of the otherwise case is $(1-\frac{x_i}{x_i^*})$.
Hence, the information gained by measuring this spot is
$$-[\frac{x_i}{x_i^*} \log_2 \frac{x_i}{x_i^*}+(1-\frac{x_i}{x_i^*})
\log_2 (1-\frac{x_i}{x_i^*})]
$$
For the whole lane $i$, the information of all spots' occupancies can
be given by
\begin{equation}\label{equ:info_lane_h}
H_i(x_i) = -h_i[\frac{x_i}{x_i^*} \log_2
\frac{x_i}{x_i^*}+(1-\frac{x_i}{x_i^*}) \log_2 (1-\frac{x_i}{x_i^*})]
\end{equation}
where $h_i$ is the length of lane $i$. Since $h_i$ is proportional to
the capacity $x_i^*$, \eqref{equ:info_lane_h} can be simplified to
\begin{align}
H_i(x_i) &= -x_i^*[\frac{x_i}{x_i^*} \log_2
\frac{x_i}{x_i^*}+(1-\frac{x_i}{x_i^*}) \log_2
(1-\frac{x_i}{x_i^*})] \nonumber\\
&=-[x_i \log_2 \frac{x_i}{x_i^*}+(x_i^*-x_i) \log_2
(1-\frac{x_i}{x_i^*})] \label{equ:info_lane}
\end{align}
By summarizing all lanes, we have the information of the entire
system as follows
\begin{align}
H(\vec{x}) &= \sum_{i=1}^n H_i(x_i)\nonumber\\
&= - \sum_{i=1}^n [x_i \log_2 \frac{x_i}{x_i^*}+(x_i^*-x_i) \log_2
(1-\frac{x_i}{x_i^*})]\label{equ:info_network_sum}
\end{align}
Furthermore, \eqref{equ:info_network_sum} can be restated as the
vector expression:
\begin{equation}\label{equ:info}
H(\vec{x}) = -\vec{x}^T\log_2\mat{P}\vec{x}
-(\vec{x}^*-\vec{x})^T\log_2(\vec{\epsilon-\mat{P}\vec{x}})
\end{equation}
We define this expression as the \textbf{transportation information}.
It represents the uncertainty or unpredictability of the system
crowdedness by knowing only the queue lengths and the lane
capacities.

\subsection{Signification}

The transportation information \eqref{equ:info} comes from the
consideration of the occupancies of traffic areas. Precisely, it
measures the uncertainty of the occupancies. If the occupancy of a
traffic spot is more uncertain, it is more difficult to predict
whether there is a vehicle in this spot without direct observation,
which means this spot has higher liquidity. In other words, the
greater information \eqref{equ:info} implies the higher liquidity of
the transportation system. It is clear that the liquidity corresponds
to the transportation functionality. Hence, the transportation
information is related with the transportation functionality of the
system. The sequel will discuss this relationship in details.

% FOR A LANE
Firstly, consider a single lane $i$, $i\in\{1,\cdots,n\}$, its
information $H_i$ due to all possible queue length $x_i$ is
illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:info_lane}. Observe that when the lane
is empty ($x_i=0$), the information equals zero ($H_i=0$). This is
because any spot within this lane is certainly not occupied by a
vehicle. This lane is extremely clean in this case. However, since no
vehicle travels inside, no transportation behavior appears in this
lane. In other words, the system contributes nothing to the
transportation functionality with zero usage.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{pics/lane}\\
  \caption{Information vs queue length for a lane}
  \label{fig:info_lane}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, when the lane is totally occupied ($x_i=x_i^*$),
since the occupancy of any spot is also certain in this case, the
information $H_i$ also equals zero. The usage of the system is
extremely high in this case. But, because there is no space to move,
the transportation behavior can not happen either. Hence, with
complete crowdedness, the system also contributes nothing to the
transportation functionality.

Now, we can summarize that the urban transportation functions only
under these two conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[\textbf{C1}] there are vehicles; \label{list:c1}
  \item[\textbf{C2}] there are free spaces to allow the vehicles
      to move. \label{list:c2}
\end{enumerate}
Therefore, only when $0<x_i<x_i^*$, these two conditions are both
verified so that this lane can contribute to the transportation
functionality.

Observe that only when $0<x_i<x_i^*$, the information $H_i$ becomes
positive because the occupancies are uncertain in this case.
Specially, $H_i$ maximizes when the lane is half-occupied
($x_i=x_i^*/2$). For a lane, its information $H_i$ reflects the
balance between the low usage and the high crowdedness. Hence, it can
be inferred that for a lane, its information happens to correspond to
its contribution to the transportation functionality.

% FOR NETWORK
Then, we consider the relationship between the transportation
information and the distribution of vehicles over different lanes. A
simple example is a system including two lanes. Define $x_1$, $x_2$
are the queue lengths and $x_1^*$, $x_2^*$ are the capacities.
Suppose $x_1^*<x_2^*$ and the sum $N=x_1+x_2$ is fixed. Figure
\ref{fig:info_twolane} shows the information due to $x_1$ in three
cases: $N\le x^*_1\le x^*_2$, $x^*_1\le N\le x^*_2$ and $x^*_1\le
x^*_2\le N$. The information maximizes in certain point $x_p$, which
is given by in all three cases
$$x_p = \frac{N}{x_1^*+x_2^*} x_1^*$$
Clearly, the information reflects the balance between these two
lanes.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \subfigure[$N\le x^*_1\le x^*_2$]
  {\includegraphics{pics/twolane_s}}
  \subfigure[$x^*_1\le N\le x^*_2$]
  {\includegraphics{pics/twolane_m}}
  \subfigure[$x^*_1\le x^*_2\le N$]
  {\includegraphics{pics/twolane_l}}\\
  \caption{Information of two lanes with fixed total vehicles}
  \label{fig:info_twolane}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, the following theorem indicates that for any large-scale
transportation network, the information maximizes when the vehicles
are distributed uniformly.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:info_max}
For any transportation network including $n$ lanes, assume that the
total amount of vehicles $N$ is given, the transportation information
\eqref{equ:info} is maximized when the vehicles are distributed
uniformly.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
To maximize the information, consider the problem
\begin{align}\label{equ:pro_max_info}
\max\; &H(\vec{x}) = -\vec{x}^T\log_2\mat{P}\vec{x}
-(\vec{x}^*-\vec{x})^T\log_2(\vec{\epsilon-\mat{P}\vec{x}})\\
s.t.\; &\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = N \nonumber
\end{align}
Since
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial^2 H}{\partial x_i\partial x_j} &= 0,\;\forall
i,j\in\{1,\cdots,n\},i\neq j\\
\frac{\partial^2 H}{\partial x_i^2} &= -\frac{1}{\ln
2}(\frac{1}{x_i}+\frac{1}{x_i^*-x_i})<0,\;\forall i\in\{1,\cdots,n\}
\end{align*}
we know that $H(\vec{x})$ is a concave function. By applying the
method of Lagrange multipliers to solve the problem
\eqref{equ:pro_max_info}, we have the equivalent unconstrained
problem:
$$\max J(\vec{x},\beta) =
-\vec{x}^T\log_2\mat{P}\vec{x}
-(\vec{x}^*-\vec{x})^T\log_2(\vec{\epsilon-\mat{P}\vec{x}})
+\beta(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - N)$$
whose solution can be obtained by solving the equations
\begin{align}
\label{equ:tmp_max_J_1}
\frac{\partial J}{\partial x_i} &=
-\log_2\frac{x_i}{x_i^*}+\log_2(1-\frac{x_i}{x_i^*})+\beta =0,
\forall i\in\{1,\cdots,n\}\\
\label{equ:tmp_max_J_2}
\frac{\partial J}{\partial \beta} &= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i - N =0
\end{align}
Now, \eqref{equ:tmp_max_J_1} can easily infer that
$$\frac{x_1}{x_1^*}=\cdots=\frac{x_n}{x_n^*}=\frac{1}{1+2^{-\beta}}
$$
Apparently, this implies the uniform distribution of vehicles, which
completes the proof.
\end{proof}

The uniform distribution of vehicles implies that all traffic areas
are equally used, there is no waste and no overuse. This state leads
to the  highest overall liquidity of the transportation system.

Now, by combining the analysis of single lane and network, we can see
that the transportation information reflects the balance between low
usage and high crowdedness and the balance between different traffic
areas. Hence, it can be further concluded that the transportation
information \eqref{equ:info} measures the contribution of the
transportation system to the transportation functionality.

\subsection{Comparison Between Entropy and Information}

% ENTROPY: CONTROL OBJECTIVE
% INFORMATION: FUNCTIONALITY OF TRANSPORTATION

From the approaches of classical thermodynamics and expanded Shannon
information, this paper has presented the entropy
\eqref{equ:Tran_entropy} and the information \eqref{equ:info} for the
transportation system. We close this section by comparing these two
novel concepts.

From different bases, the significations of these two concepts are
very different. By considering the vehicles as the energy, the
transportation entropy is presented based on the parallelism between
the transportation system and the thermodynamic system. It is the sum
of traffic densities of all vehicles, which is opposite to the
service quality supplied by the system to the vehicles. Obviously,
the entropy focuses on the performances of the vehicles and it is
desired to be reduced.

But on the other hand, the transportation information measures the
system contribution to the transportation functionality. It comes
from the consideration of the occupancy states of all traffic areas.
Different from the entropy, the transportation information focuses on
the performance of the transportation system and it is desired to be
increased.

This difference appears in their relationships with the queue
lengths. The entropy \eqref{equ:Tran_entropy} is a monotonic function
of queue lengths. It is obvious that every vehicle hopes to share the
traffic resources with as less vehicles as possible. But, the
transportation information \eqref{equ:info} approaches zero when the
number of vehicles approaches zero because transportation
functionality needs the vehicles and too few of them will lead to big
waste of traffic infrastructures. More precisely, the considerations
based on the entropy desire that the vehicles are reduced as many as
possible, while the maximization of the information desires that the
lanes are half-occupied.

Apparently, the transportation entropy is more appropriate to be the
objective of traffic signal control. The aim of the traffic signals
focuses more on the vehicles rather than the transportation
functionality of the whole system. On the other hand, the
transportation information is a good evaluation of the transportation
system itself. It reflects the balance between the vehicles (users)
and the traffic areas (resources). In our opinion, the information
\eqref{equ:info} is also more useful in the domains, such as the
transportation infrastructure design, the urban planning, etc.

At last, we note that these two notions have comme features to
consider the distribution law of vehicles. No matter to minimize the
entropy or to maximize the information, the vehicles are both desired
to be distributed uniformly, which implies that the uniform
distribution of vehicles is beneficial to both the vehicles and the
transportation system.

\section{Conclusion}

This paper has presented a novel thermodynamic approach for studying
the transportation system. The comparison between the thermodynamic
system and the transportation system showed that they are similar by
regarding the vehicles as the energy and regarding the traffic lanes
as the thermodynamic subsystems. With this similarity, the
transportation system has been analogized to the thermodynamic
system. In particular, it has been demonstrated that the
transportation system can have a similar notion of the entropy to
measure the system disorder. With this notion, this paper presented
the dissipativeness of the transportation system to correspond to the
second law of thermodynamics. This dissipativeness makes the system
tend to decrease the disorder and hence become better organized.
Though it is not verified naturally, it can be used as the objective
and the evaluation of the traffic signal control. Furthermore, this
paper proposed that the nominal situation is appropriate to
correspond to the closed status of the thermodynamic system. The
equilibrium state was also introduced into the transportation context
to represent the uniform distribution of the vehicles. Beyond the
classical thermodynamic approach, this paper also applied the
Shannon's point of view to present the transportation information,
which measures the system contribution to the transportation
functionality.

With all these efforts, this paper has constructed a novel
thermodynamic point of view in traffic engineering. This work is a
completely new attempt to discover the nature of the transportation
system. Based on the contributions of this paper, other thermodynamic
results can be further applied into the transportation context.
