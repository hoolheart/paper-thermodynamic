This is a latex paper to present a novel thermodynamic point of view for urban transportation system.

### Initial version

The initial version includes all major aspects of this paper. Specially, the content consists of

1. Basic correspondence between thermodynamic system and transportation system
2. Presentation of transportation entropy
3. Dissipative law of transportation entropy
4. Correspondence between nominal situation and isolated status
5. Transportation information based on Shannon's entropy

### Reduction

The information theory point of view, which comes from Shannon's entropy, has truned out to be not solid. Besides, it has few connections with the thermodynamic point of view, which is the major content and proved to be solid. Hence, it is not appropriate to contain this material in this particular paper. The information theory point of view should be deleted. Maybe later, after it is improved, another paper can developed to present the idea.
