This is a latex paper to present a novel thermodynamic point of view for urban transportation system.

### Initial version

The initial version includes all major aspects of this paper. Specially, the content consists of

1. Basic correspondence between thermodynamic system and transportation system
2. Presentation of transportation entropy
3. Dissipative law of transportation entropy
4. Correspondence between nominal situation and isolated status
5. Transportation information based on Shannon's entropy

### Reduction

The information theory point of view, which comes from Shannon's entropy, has truned out to be not solid. Besides, it has few connections with the thermodynamic point of view, which is the major content and proved to be solid. Hence, it is not appropriate to contain this material in this particular paper. The information theory point of view should be deleted. Maybe later, after it is improved, another paper can developed to present the idea.

### Revision after rejection

The rejection comments and the relative revision plan are stated in `review_comments.md`. The major revisions are

1. change `queue length` to `number of vehicles`;
2. `I(k)` is **NOT** the sum of densities, it is the evaluation of service quality;
3. change `closed status` to `isolated status`;
4. note that the occupancy equilibrium is not a real stable state;
5. discuss a little about the future work in Conclusion.

### Improvements
*December 13th, 2013*

1. The occupancy equilibrium corresponds to the minimal transportation entropy and minimal ectropy. Theorem 3 is devoted to show this relationship, the proof is improved by using more mathmatical language. The signification is also corrected according to the thermal equilibrium.
2. The second way to show the signification of transportation entropy explores its relationship with the number of vehicles ||x||_2.
