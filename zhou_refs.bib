  abstract = {The problem of designing network-wide traffic signal control strategies
	for large-scale congested urban road networks is considered. One
	known and two novel methodologies, all based on the store-and-forward
	modeling paradigm, are presented and compared. The known methodology
	is a linear multivariable feedback regulator derived through the
	formulation of a linear-quadratic optimal control problem. An alternative,
	novel methodology consists of an open-loop constrained quadratic
	optimal control problem, whose numerical solution is achieved via
	quadratic programming. Yet a different formulation leads to an open-loop
	constrained nonlinear optimal control problem, whose numerical solution
	is achieved by use of a feasible-direction algorithm. A preliminary
	simulation-based investigation of the signal control problem for
	a large-scale urban road network using these methodologies demonstrates
	the comparative efficiency and real-time feasibility of the developed
	signal control methods.},

	control methodology, which offers a computationally feasible technique
	for real-time network-wide signal control in large-scale urban traffic
	networks and is applicable also under congested traffic conditions.
	In this methodology, the traffic flow process is modeled by use of
	the store-and-forward modeling paradigm, and the problem of network-wide
	signal control (including all constraints) is formulated as a quadratic-programming
	problem that aims at minimizing and balancing the link queues so
	as to minimize the risk of queue spillback. For the application of
	the proposed methodology in real time, the corresponding optimization
	algorithm is embedded in a rolling-horizon (model-predictive) control
	scheme. The control strategy’s efficiency and real-time feasibility
	is demonstrated and compared with the Linear-Quadratic approach taken
	by the signal control strategy TUC (Traffic-responsive Urban Control)
	as well as with optimized fixed-control settings via their simulation-based
	application to the road network of the city centre of Chania, Greece,
	under a number of different demand scenarios. The comparative evaluation
	is based on various criteria and tools including the recently proposed
	fundamental diagram for urban network traffic.},

  abstract = {A general method is developed for the dynamic optimization of multi-commodity
	flows in an oversaturated, store-and-forward transportation network.
	The network is characterized by time-varying inputs, and the existence
	of queues in front of certain nodes where the incoming flows exceed
	the capacity to discharge them, during a certain period of oversaturation.
	The method consists of discretizing in time and solving a linear
	programming {(LP)} problem, in order to obtain the order of exhaustion
	of the various queues and an approximation to their, optimum time
	variation. The {LP} solution may be refined to any degree of desired
	accuracy, or used as a first step in a two-step procedure, where
	the order of exhaustion of the queues of the {LP} solution is used
	in a variational scheme to obtain the exact solution. The method
	is demonstrated by optimizing the operation of a two-node, four-queue
	network.},

	over complex networks can be predicted over time, based on a simple
	macroscopic computer representation of traffic flow that is consistent
	with the kinematic wave theory under all traffic conditions. The
	method does not use ad hoc procedures to treat special situations.
	After a brief review of the basic model for one link, the article
	describes how three-legged junctions can be modeled. It then introduces
	a numerical procedure for networks, assuming that a time-varying
	origin-destination {(O-D)} table is given and that the proportion
	of turns at every junction is known. These assumptions are reasonable
	for numerical analysis of disaster evacuation plans. The results
	are then extended to the case where, instead of the turning proportions,
	the best routes to each destination from every junction are known
	at all times. For technical reasons explained in the text, the procedure
	is more complicated in this case, requiring more computer memory
	and more time for execution. The effort is estimated to be about
	an order of magnitude greater than for the static traffic assignment
	problem on a network of the same size. The procedure is ideally suited
	for parallel computing. It is hoped that the results in the article
	will lead to more realistic models of freeway flow, disaster evacuations
	and dynamic traffic assignment for the evening commute.},

	control {(MPC)} is their inability to deal explicitly with plant
	model uncertainty. In this paper, we present a new approach for robust
	{MPC} synthesis that allows explicit incorporation of the description
	of plant uncertainty in the problem formulation. The uncertainty
	is expressed in both the time and frequency domains. The goal is
	to design, at each time step, a state-feedback control law that minimizes
	a {\lq}worst-case{\rq} infinite horizon objective function, subject
	to constraints on the control input and plant output. Using standard
	techniques, the problem of minimizing an upper bound on the {\lq}worst-case{\rq}
	objective function, subject to input and output constraints, is reduced
	to a convex optimization involving linear matrix inequalities {(LMIs).}
	It is shown that the feasible receding horizon state-feedback control
	design robustly stabilizes the set of uncertain plants. Several extensions,
	such as application to systems with time delays, problems involving
	constant set-point tracking, trajectory tracking and disturbance
	rejection, which follow naturally from our formulation, are discussed.
	The controller design is illustrated with two examples.},

	an optimal control sequence and the first control in this sequence
	is applied to the plant. An important advantage of this type of control

	remains a challenge in control engineering to a great extent due
	to their sheer size, intrinsic complexity, and nonlinear behavior.
	Recently, control engineers have looked for unconventional means
	for modeling and control of complex dynamic systems, in particular
	the technology of multi-agent systems whose appeal stems from their
	composite nature, flexibility, and scalability. This paper contributes
	to this evolving technology by proposing a framework for multi-agent
	control of linear dynamic systems, which decomposes a centralized
	model predictive control problem into a network of coupled, but small
	sub-problems that are solved by the distributed agents. Theoretical
	results ensure convergence of the distributed iterations to a globally
	optimal solution. The framework is applied to the signaling split
	control of traffic networks. Experiments conducted with simulation
	software indicate that the multi-agent framework attains performance
	comparable to conventional control. The main advantages of the multi-agent
	framework are its graceful extension and localized reconfiguration,
	which require adjustments only in the control strategies of the agents
	in the vicinity.},

	and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified
	the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such
	a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist1 and Hartley2
	on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to
	include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise
	in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure
	of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination
	of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that
	of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message
	selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning;
	that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system
	with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects
	of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant
	aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible
	messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible
	selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this
	is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the
	set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this
	number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when
	one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely.
	As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic
	function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably
	when we consider the influence of the statistics of the message and
	when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases
	use an essentially logarithmic measure.},

	design problem (\{NDP)\} under demand uncertainty. The origin–destination
	trip matrices are taken as random variables with known probability
	distributions. Instead of finding optimal network design solutions
	for a given future scenario, we are concerned with solutions that
	are in some sense “good” for a variety of demand realizations. We
	introduce a definition of robustness accounting for the planner's
	required degree of robustness. We propose a formulation of the robust
	network design problem (\{RNDP)\} and develop a methodology based
	on genetic algorithm (\{GA)\} to solve the \{RNDP.\} The proposed
	model generates globally near-optimal network design solutions, f,
	based on the planner's input for robustness. The study makes two
	important contributions to the network design literature. First,
	robust network design solutions are significantly different from
	the deterministic \{NDPs\} and not accounting for them could potentially
	underestimate the network-wide impacts. Second, systematic evaluation
	of the performance of the model and solution algorithm is conducted
	on different test networks and budget levels to explore the efficacy
	of this approach. The results highlight the importance of accounting
	for robustness in transportation planning and the proposed approach
	is capable of producing high-quality solutions.},

  abstract = {Recently, a bilevel programming approach has been used for estimation
	of origin-destination (O-D) matrix in congested networks. This approach
	integrates the conventional generalized least squares estimation
	model and the standard network equilibrium model into one process.
	We extend this approach and develop a more general model and efficient
	heuristic algorithms to handle more realistic situation where link
	flow interaction cannot be ignored. The extended model is formulated
	in the form of a bilevel programming problem with variational inequality
	constraints. The upper-level problem seeks to minimize the sum of
	error measurements in traffic counts and O-D matrices, while the
	lower-level problem represents a network equilibrium problem formulated
	as variational inequalities, which guarantees that the estimated
	O-D matrix and corresponding link flows satisfy the network equilibrium
	conditions. Two computational techniques are presented for solving
	the bilevel O-D matrix estimation model. One is a heuristic iterative
	algorithm between traffic assignment and O-D matrix estimation and
	the other one is a sensitivity analysis based heuristic algorithm.
	Properties of the two algorithms are analyzed theoretically and compared
	numerically with small network examples. It is concluded that both
	algorithms can be used as efficient approaches for the bilevel O-D
	matrix estimation problems.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a fuzzy-neural model {(FNM)} to predict the traffic
	flows in an urban street network, which has long been considered
	a major element in the responsive urban traffic control systems.
	The {FNM} consists of two modules: a gate network {(GN)} and an expert
	network {(EN).} The {GN} classifies the input data into a number
	of clusters using a fuzzy approach, and the {EN} specifies the input--output
	relationship as in a conventional neural network approach. While
	the {GN} groups traffic patterns of similar characteristics into
	clusters, the {EN} models the specific relationship within each cluster.
	An online rolling training procedure is proposed to train the {FNM},
	which enhances its predictive power through adaptive adjustments
	of the model coefficients in response to the real-time traffic conditions.
	Both simulation and real observation data are used to demonstrative
	the effectiveness of the method.},

	is modeled as a discrete-time state space model. It is found that
	the system is not completely controllable and hence, the system is
	decomposed into controllable subsystem and free one. To avoid congestion
	and reduce the impact of disturbance, H∞ control method is adapted
	and a traffic-responsive strategy under state and control constraints
	is constructed by means of Linear Matrix Inequality {(LMI).} Finally,
	a system including two intersections is studied in order to illustrate
